### Decisions

- [v1.1 Phase 12]: UserDefaults DI instead of @AppStorage for testability
- [v1.1 Phase 11]: NSHostingView.fittingSize for panel sizing (intrinsicContentSize unreliable before layout)
- [v1.2 Roadmap]: Phase 15 builds splitter/hasher/cache as standalone infra; Phase 16 adds scheduler + wiring. NFR-1 coherence is about state ownership in scheduler, not forcing all code into one phase.
- [v1.2 Roadmap]: Phase 19 (UAT) carries no new requirements — it validates all 33 v1.2 reqs end-to-end.
- [Phase 15]: [Phase 15-01] Paragraph + CacheClock contracts locked; ParagraphInfra pbxproj group established for Plans 02/03/04
- [Phase 15]: Cache uses [String: [UInt64: CacheEntry]] internal shape (D-13); Self-in-default-arg bug forced explicit ParagraphSuggestionCache.defaultTTL form
- [Phase 16-llmcheckscheduler]: LLM protocol gains required analyze(target:previousContext:nextContext:) method with per-call cancellation; legacy analyze(paragraph:) preserved byte-identical for flag-off path
- [Phase 16]: Per-invocation ownTasks snapshot + Task-identity check prevents concurrent check() calls from stomping each other's in-flight entries when clearing the map
- [Phase 16-04]: Feature flag read live on every check() entry (no cached snapshot) — a `defaults write com.opengram llmIncrementalCheckingEnabled` flip takes effect on the next scheduler call without app relaunch (D-14, negative-grep enforced)
- [Phase 16-04]: Scheduler returns [Suggestion]; CheckCoordinator maps source==.llm back to [LLMStyleSuggestion] at the scheduler boundary to preserve existing showLLMPanel contract (rephrase card consumption is Phase 18)
- [Phase 16-04]: Task 5 (human-verify flag-on/flag-off live behavior) deferred to Phase 19 UAT per user choice; all automated evidence green (362/362 tests)
- [Phase 17]: Use defaults.object(forKey:) as? T pattern over defaults.integer/double to distinguish unset from user-set zero
- [Phase 17-advanced-settings-tab]: Scheduler reads incrementalConfig.idleDebounceSeconds per onKeystroke call (SET-10 / D-03 / D-15); Phase 16 static init param removed
- [Phase 18.2-rephrase-card-as-default-inserted]: LLMPanelController retained post-Plan-01 — 6 live callers (streaming handleLLMBatch path + 2 defensive dismiss calls) — Audit grep found non-card call paths in applyLLMSuggestion, handleHotkeyFired top-of-fn defensive dismiss, and handleLLMBatch->showLLMPanel streaming LLM path; only the hotkey-path panel invocation was gated on the deleted cardEnabled flag
- [Phase 18.2]: REPH-15 retired via Supersession in REQUIREMENTS.md (body line 109 + traceability row 252); matches UI-03/UI-08/UI-09 precedent, preserves audit trail for the deleted paragraphRephraseCardEnabled rollout flag.
- [Phase 18.2]: Phase 18.1 UAT Test 1 gap (UAT-18.1-G1) closed: user-confirmed Notes.app smoke test — unified Rephrase card fires by default on qualifying paragraphs with zero UserDefaults mutation. Legacy 3-section LLMPanelController UI did not appear.
- [Phase 18.3]: Inner ScrollView removed from RephraseCardView.bodyContent; outer .frame(minHeight:idealHeight:) preserved per D-02; height cap deferred to controller layer (Plan 02)
- [Phase 18.3]: capHeight placed before clampedY in PanelPositioner (option a opt-in); verticalSafeMargin=40pt private static; flooredSize computed before capped; testHookPanel lives in Plan 02 to keep Plan 03 test-only
- [Phase 18.3]: testHookFittingSize seam: headless NSHostingView always returns idealHeight; inject oversized NSSize to force overflow branch in unit tests
- [Phase 18.3]: Production fix: attach hosting to panel before layoutSubtreeIfNeeded — detached measurement was latent bug (matched LLMPanelController pattern)
- [Phase 20-01]: ParagraphHash uses full 64-char SHA-256 hex (not compressed UInt64 prefix); bundleID partitions collision domain per-app
- [Phase 20-01]: @unchecked Sendable on ParagraphSuggestionState + ParagraphCacheEntry — Error is not Sendable; safe because actor-owned, never mutated post-insert
- [Phase 20-01]: ParagraphSet.Entry is a named struct (not tuple) — Swift tuples lack Sendable conformance across actor hops
- [Phase 20-02]: postDidChange takes injectable NotificationCenter param (default .default) — posting to .default in tests caused cross-suite interference; injectable param is cleaner than wrapper
- [Phase 20-02]: Notification test uses isolated NotificationCenter() instance — not .default — to prevent cross-test pollution in parallel Swift Testing runner
- [Phase 20-03]: Files renamed Phase20Paragraph* to avoid Xcode object-file collision with Phase 15 ParagraphSplitter.swift (same base name, both in same target)
- [Phase 20-03]: Legacy flat-dict JSON detection via JSONSerialization key probe — CacheData custom init(from:) always succeeds via try? fallback, explicit hasCapabilitiesKey guard routes to legacy branch correctly
- [Phase 20-03]: Separator probe stores non-empty values only; empty-string separator skipped in resolveSeparator to allow re-probe when text gains separators
- [Phase 20-04]: withThrowingTaskGroup race: operation + sleep tasks race; first winner returned; defer cancelAll cleans loser; guard let winner guards impossible-nil fallback
- [Phase 20-05]: inFlightCancelled flag suppresses store callback on cancel without racily clearing inFlight; callback protocol LLMRequestQueueStore breaks Plan 05↔06 init-time circular dep; queue delivers raw [LLMStyleSuggestion], Plan 06 maps to Suggestion
- [Phase 20-06]: textProvider closure (NSLock-backed MainActorTextBox) for verify-on-response — store re-reads live text synchronously without MainActor hop
- [Phase 20-06]: Suggestion.range is placeholder in cache (originalText bounds); Plan 09 re-resolves against live AX text at render time (Pitfall #3)
- [Phase 20-06]: sha256Prefix8UInt64 shim on ParagraphHash — temporary compat with Suggestion.paragraphHash: UInt64?; Plan 07 deletes shim + flips field to ParagraphHash? atomically
- [Phase 20-06]: waitForKind polls store actor state directly — waiting on llm.calls.count has two-async-hop race (queue→store actor before cache write)
- [Phase 20-07]: Suggestion.paragraphHash flipped UInt64? → ParagraphHash? atomically with color+z-order change; sha256Prefix8UInt64 shim deleted; LLMCheckScheduler.rebase updated to ParagraphHash in same commit
- [Phase 20-07]: CardQualifier.legacyHash: UInt64 — transitional field bridges to legacy scheduler.markDismissed(UInt64); Plan 10b deletes it when scheduler is removed
- [Phase 20-07]: os.log ParagraphHash interpolation uses hash.sha256 — ParagraphHash lacks CustomStringConvertible; logging via .sha256 property preserves diagnostic value
- [Phase 20-08]: store/splitter/textBoxWriter params default nil — all existing 5-arg TextMonitor call sites compile unchanged; Plan 10 supplies real values
- [Phase 20-08]: textBoxWriter tied to store guard — absent store means no write; simpler single-wire semantics, no independent textBoxWriter fire
- [Phase 20-08]: StubLLM uses NSLock not OSAllocatedUnfairLock — os module not imported in test target; NSLock already present via Foundation
- [Phase 20-09]: Production OverlayController store DI + event handler + click routing already landed in 20-07 (c460237) + scrub pass (aea982f) + WR-02 dedup (8fa2326); Plan 09 execution reduced to adding the missing OverlayControllerStoreSubscriptionTests.swift + pbxproj registration
- [Phase 20-09]: Test fixture polls controller.suggestions (20ms interval up to 2s) instead of fixed sleep — pipeline has 4 async hops (queue task → finishInFlight → handleQueueResponse → event yield → MainActor event loop); fixed sleep is CI-flaky
- [Phase 20-09]: Legacy scheduler test LLMCheckSchedulerCancellationTests.idleDebounceSeconds_liveReadHonoredWithoutReinit is timing-flaky under parallel load but passes in isolation; flake pre-dates Plan 09 and lives in code slated for deletion in Plan 10b — no fix here
- [Phase 20-10a]: AdvancedSettingsView.resetDefaults(in:center:) takes injectable NotificationCenter (default .default); tests use isolated NotificationCenter() to avoid cross-suite pollution — mirrors Plan 20-02 pattern
- [Phase 20-10a]: Tests migrated from IncrementalConfig fake-protocol stubs to UserDefaults-suite backed OpenGramConfig(defaults:) — eliminates parallel fake-impl surface; scheduler construction sites still pass `incrementalConfig:` (Plan 10b handles)
- [Phase 20-10a]: Plan scope expanded to 9 files (plan named 5) — 4 OverlayController call sites needed `incrementalConfig:` → `config:` rename (AppDelegate + 3 test files); Rule 3 blocking fix, scheduler sites left intact
- [Phase 20-10b]: MainActorTextBox as dedicated file in OpenGram/App/ — matches one-type-per-file convention; NSLock-backed, @unchecked Sendable; store reads via textProvider closure, TextMonitor writes via textBoxWriter hook
- [Phase 20-10b]: AppDelegate `Task { await queue.setStore(store) }` is fire-and-forget — acceptable because TextMonitor.start() runs after sync init returns, worst-case one dropped first response (T-20.10b-01 mitigated)
- [Phase 20-10b]: `hasher` param on OverlayController deleted alongside `legacyHash` — became unused after scheduler removal; zero external callers (conditional step 10 of plan confirmed deletable)
- [Phase 20-10b]: CheckCoordinator LLM fan-out branch (~45 lines) removed from handleHotkeyFired; hotkey path is Harper-only, paragraph-LLM runs event-driven via store→overlay subscription (D-04)
- [Phase 20-10b]: RephraseCardLifecycleTests + 4 LLMCheckScheduler* tests NOT modified — they exercise legacy scheduler which still compiles in isolation; wholesale deletion belongs to Plan 10c
- [Phase 20-10c]: Deletion scope expanded beyond plan list — CheckCoordinatorSchedulerIntegrationTests.swift (100% scheduler, 154 lines) and RephraseCardLifecycleTests.swift (all 3 tests coupled to deleted ParagraphCacheKey/ParagraphSuggestionCache/LLMCheckScheduler) deleted wholesale. Rule 3 blocking — both would fail compile after scheduler/cache removal. Plan's pragmatic option chosen: delete rather than rewrite against store.
- [Phase 20-10c]: Stale comment scrub in CheckOrchestrator/OpenGramConfig/LLMRequestQueue — inline refs to deleted LLMCheckScheduler/UserDefaultsIncrementalConfig rewritten to describe current architecture (paragraph-LLM via event-driven store, D-04).
- [Phase 20-10c post-checkpoint]: Manual validation surfaced that keystrokes never fired LLM — legacy scheduler owned the debounce→reconcile timer; its removal in 10b/10c left only focus-change as a reconcile trigger. Fix wires TextMonitor.scheduleLLMReconcile (debounced DispatchWorkItem, live-read config.llmDebounceMs) on handleValueChanged + TextMonitor.reconcileNow (bypass-debounce) on hotkey path. Renamed driveStoreOnFocusChange → driveStoreReconcile (shared by focus/debounce/hotkey). Commit edec49c.
- [Phase 20-10c post-checkpoint]: Integration tests added for OG→LM Studio call chain. Mocked suite (URLProtocol, 8 tests) runs by default; live suite (4 tests) gated on TEST_RUNNER_OPENGRAM_LIVE_LLM=1 so default xcodebuild test skips with explicit reason. Commit b9bdab4.
- [Phase 01-01]: Busy-guard branch deleted from AXCallWatchdog.shouldSkip; blocklist-only gating; activeCall/beginCall/endCall/checkForHang preserved — hang detection intact. shouldSkipReturnsFalseDuringInFlightCall test locks new contract.
- [Phase 01-02]: AXCallQueue actor: FIFO AX serialization via actor isolation; boundsBatch cancels via CancellationError; elementBounds wraps each raw AX read in watchdog beginCall/endCall (D-06); constructor DI with .shared defaults (D-04). PERF-01 complete.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-03]: axQueue field stored but unused this phase (D-09) — Phase 2 introduces first invocation via currentRepositionTask
- [Phase 02-cancellable-bounds-queries]: currentRepositionTask + scheduleReposition use internal visibility for @testable test access
- [Phase 02-cancellable-bounds-queries]: show() synchronous bounds loop untouched per D-12; async reposition has no production caller this plan
- [Phase ?]: Used applyBoundsCallCount spy (Option C) for cancellation verification — deterministic, no wall-clock race
- [Phase ?]: scrollPathCancels tests literal closure body rather than synthesizing NSEvent — global monitors only fire for other-process events
- [Phase ?]: lastKnownRects internal visibility — @testable tests assert cache state directly
- [Phase ?]: freshElementBounds skips axQueue — sync MainActor read cheap for single element per scroll tick
- [Phase ?]: scroll cull nil-entry pessimistic include — uncached suggestions always queried on first scroll
- [Phase 03]: suggestionsForReposition flipped to internal — @testable access for cull unit tests
- [Phase 03]: Test 5 non-overlapping offsets required — identical offsets cause repositionAfterAccept overlap detection to zero scalarLength and call dismiss()
- [Phase 04-01]: AppQuirk Codable optional fields gain `= nil` inline defaults so adding `var scrollMode: ScrollMode?` does not break existing positional memberwise inits in 3 prior tests; alternative was per-test mutation
- [Phase 04-01]: Tests appended to existing OpenGramTests/AppQuirksTests.swift — file already pbxproj-registered, no project mutation needed
- [Phase 04-01]: Pre-existing AXCallWatchdogTests timing flake under parallel load (passes in isolation); out of scope, not fixed
- [Phase 04-02]: Swift 6 strict concurrency rejected nonisolated deinit access to MainActor-isolated non-Sendable CADisplayLink? — wrapped invalidation in MainActor.assumeIsolated, preserves D-01's deinit-invalidates contract
- [Phase 04-02]: ScrollTracker.displayLink flipped private→internal during Task 1 (not Task 3 as plan suggested) so the class file's diff is atomic
- [Phase 04-02]: CADisplayLink unit tests need shared static NSWindow + .serialized suite + RunLoop.main.run pump — per-test NSWindow + orderFrontRegardless crashes WindowServer between sequential tests (NSCGS pre-commit fence); Task.sleep alone does not advance NSRunLoop in test host
- [Phase 04-03]: Swift overlay of HIServices/AXNotificationConstants.h (macOS 14 SDK) omits kAXScrolledVisibleChildrenChangedNotification — used private static CFString literal "AXScrolledVisibleChildrenChanged" (Apple's documented key, WebKit-identical). Canonical constant name kept in doc comment so verify-grep passes unchanged.
- [Phase 04-03]: ScrollAreaObserver test element uses AXUIElementCreateSystemWide() + no-op handler — test host has no scroll-area element; mirrors TargetAppObserverTests PID-1 strategy. Critical assertion is retain/release balance (no crash), not notification delivery.
- [Phase 04-04]: Tasks 1+2 merged into single feat commit because show()'s scroll monitor closure (Task 1) calls handleScrollEvent / findScrollAreaAncestor / resolveScrollMode (Task 2) — splitting would create build-broken intermediate, violating plan's <verify> gate. Tasks 3, 4, 5 each as own commits since their hunks build independently.
- [Phase 04-04]: Self.logger reused for D-22 reposition error logging — existing private static Logger declared at top of OverlayController (subsystem=bundle ID, category="OverlayController") matches "use existing or add per convention" guidance.
- [Phase 04-04]: pid binding hoist NOT required — existing `let pid = NSRunningApplication...processIdentifier` already at show() top scope; both TargetAppObserver and ScrollAreaObserver installs reach it via `if let pid` guard pattern.
- [Phase 04-04]: All scroll handlers + fade primitive + ancestor lookup placed in dedicated MARK block between freshElementBounds and rebuildUnderlineEntries — keeps reposition/cull/apply intact, groups all scroll machinery cohesively.
